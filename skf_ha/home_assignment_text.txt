Home Assignment
This assignment is designed to evaluate your ability to analyze real-world data, develop an anomaly detection method, and communicate insights effectively. It simulates a common scenario in industrial condition monitoring where early detection of abnormal behavior is critical.
Case Description
You are provided with temperature readings from an electric motor that operates continuously (24/7). The motor is equipped with a temperature sensor that records its temperature throughout its operation. Under normal conditions, the motor remains in a healthy state for most of the time. However, any developing issue is expected to manifest as a consistent, gradual increase in temperature.
The dataset contains one year of temperature measurements (from 2024). Your task is to design a method that can detect and alert when a steady upward trend in temperature occurs, indicating a potential problem.
Expected Output
Your submission should include:
A Jupyter Notebook containing well-documented code and explanations, prepared for presentation during the interview (approximately 15 minutes).
Visualizations that support your analysis (Exploratory Data Analysis).
Relevant statistical analysis of the dataset. Include only those statistics that you believe provide insights for model development or help guide your solution approach.
A detection method (classifier, algorithm, or model) that assigns each measurement a label:
1 for anomaly (steady increase detected)
0 for normal (standard operation)
A combined plot showing temperature values over time, with anomalies highlighted as red markers.
Be prepared to address the following questions during your presentation:
What do the plots represent, and how do they support the development of your model?
Which statistics did you use, and how do they help in identifying anomalies?
What are the strengths and weaknesses of your approach? Specifically, discuss:
Detection time versus event start time
False positives (incorrect alerts)
False negatives (missed anomalies)
Evaluation Criteria
Your solution will be assessed based on:
Data Understanding & Preprocessing: How well you explore and prepare the data.
Model Design & Justification: The logic behind your chosen approach and its suitability for the problem.
Visualization & Communication: Clarity and relevance of plots and explanations.
Accuracy & Robustness: How effectively your method detects steady temperature increases while minimizing false alerts.
Presentation Quality: Ability to explain your reasoning and answer questions clearly.
Technical Guidelines
You may use Python and common libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn, or others as needed.
Avoid using external APIs or pre-built anomaly detection services.
Ensure your code is reproducible and runs without errors.
Submission Instructions
Submit your Jupyter Notebook and any supporting files as a zipped folder via email before the interview.  
You will be asked to share your screen and present your results during the interview.
The assignment is expected to take 1–2 days to complete. If you need additional time, feel free to request an extension.
